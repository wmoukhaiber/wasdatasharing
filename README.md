Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"
The class project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to read in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.
Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:
1.	Download the zip file from this URL.
2.	Unzip the file.
3.	Move ALL of the following files to the SAME DIRECTORY as the R script: 
o	features.txt
o	subject_train.txt
o	subject_test.txt
o	X_train.txt
o	X_test.txt
o	y_train.txt
o	y_test.txt
Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R). Note that it requires the reshape2 package, which can be downloaded from CRAN.
The output of the R script is a tidy data set, tidy.csv.
You can read more about the data and the analysis in the code book.
