Code Book
This code book will describe the data used in this project, as well as the processing required to create the resulting tidy data set.
Overview
30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. The smartphone captured various data about their movements.
Explanation of each file
•	features.txt: Names of the 561 features.
•	activity_labels.txt: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.
•	X_train.txt: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
•	subject_train.txt: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.
•	y_train.txt: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.
•	X_test.txt: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
•	subject_test.txt: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.
•	y_test.txt: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.
More information about the files is available in README.txt. More information about the features is available in features_info.txt.
